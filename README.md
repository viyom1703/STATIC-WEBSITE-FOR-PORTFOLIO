# DESCRIPTION 

Welcome to the repository for my Static Portfolio Website, developed as part of my internship project. This website serves as a digital portfolio to showcase my academic background, technical skills, projects, hobbies, and professional links in a clean, minimal, and responsive format. Designed using core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this portfolio acts as a central hub for anyone interested in learning more about me and my work as a budding software engineer.

üìå Project Overview
This project was undertaken as part of a 4-week internship with the objective to build a personal portfolio website from scratch using static web technologies. The goal was to gain hands-on experience in designing and deploying real-world websites while applying front-end development skills in a practical scenario.

The portfolio provides details about me ‚Äî a B.Tech Computer Science student ‚Äî including my technical stack, resume, project experiences, and links to external profiles such as GitHub and LinkedIn. The project emphasizes responsive design, readability, and professional presentation.

üí° Objectives
Build a static personal portfolio using HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript.

Host the website using GitHub Pages for free and reliable access.

Include essential sections such as About Me, Skills, Projects, Resume, and Contact.

Ensure the design is clean, simple, mobile-friendly, and easy to navigate.

Demonstrate my understanding of front-end development and design aesthetics.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
HTML5 ‚Äì Structured the content and layout of the website.

CSS3 ‚Äì Styled the components and ensured responsiveness using Flexbox and Media Queries.

JavaScript (Vanilla) ‚Äì Added interactivity (where required), such as smooth scrolling and toggles.

Git & GitHub ‚Äì Version control and open-source collaboration.

GitHub Pages ‚Äì For deploying the portfolio live on the web.
